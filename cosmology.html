        <h1>Cosmology in Modern Science and the Quran</h1>
        <p>Cosmology, the study of the universe's origin, structure, and dynamics, has always fascinated humanity. Modern scientific advancements have provided profound insights into the cosmos, yet centuries ago, the Quran and Hadith offered perspectives that continue to inspire reflection.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Cosmology: Unveiling the Universe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Big Bang Theory:</strong> The prevailing model suggests that the universe originated approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot and dense singularity, leading to its ongoing expansion.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanding Universe:</strong> Observations indicate that galaxies are moving away from each other, implying that the universe is continuously expanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmic Background Radiation:</strong> Detected as a faint glow permeating the universe, this radiation is considered residual heat from the Big Bang, providing a "snapshot" of the early universe.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Quranic Insights into the Cosmos</h2>
        <p>The Quran, revealed over 1,400 years ago, contains verses that have been interpreted to align with certain modern cosmological concepts:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder?" (Quran 21:30)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some scholars interpret this verse as a reference to the universe's initial singularity and subsequent expansion, drawing parallels to the Big Bang theory.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "And the heaven, We built it with craftsmanship, and We are expanding it." (Quran 51:47)
        </blockquote>
        <p>This has been seen by some as indicative of the universe's continuous expansion.</p>
        
        <h2>Hadith Perspectives on the Universe</h2>
        <p>The Hadith literature, comprising sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), also touches upon cosmological themes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure of the Heavens:</strong> A Hadith describes the seven heavens, each with its own inhabitants and significance. During the Isra and Mi'raj (Night Journey and Ascension), the Prophet (PBUH) is reported to have traversed these seven heavens, meeting various prophets along the way.</li>
            <li><strong>Prostration of the Sun:</strong> In Sahih Bukhari, it's narrated that the Prophet (PBUH) said:
                <blockquote>
                    "The sun goes and prostrates itself underneath the Throne, and takes the permission to rise again..."
                </blockquote>
                This Hadith has been interpreted metaphorically by scholars, emphasizing the submission of celestial bodies to the divine order.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bridging Faith and Science</h2>
        <p>While the Quran and Hadith are not scientific texts, many Muslims find harmony between these scriptures and modern scientific discoveries. The reflections on the cosmos within Islamic texts encourage believers to ponder the universe's wonders, fostering a sense of awe and spirituality.</p>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The exploration of cosmology through both modern science and Islamic teachings offers a comprehensive understanding of the universe. It underscores the profound connection between faith and reason, inviting continuous contemplation and appreciation of the cosmos.</p>
